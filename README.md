## VoiceAI

```
This program is a virtual assitant (example of simple AI without machine learning) It will listen to you and do accordingly
It will begin with wishing you 'Good Morning / Afternoon / Evening' according to the time of the day
and then introducing herself as the name of voice 'Zira' 
then the program will start listening to your default microphone 
it will store your voice and then convert it into text, and will do what you ask her to 
Try saying: 'who's your father', 'what's the time', 'search for <---> on wikipedia', 'change to male voice', 'open youtube', 
'meow', 'open google', 'open stackoverflow', ... you can even add more to this, just add another {elif} in the end of program
